MOTION : This house would not sell out// This house would choose a job aligned with passion, not money. 
TYPE   : REBUTTAL SPEECH
i'm going to talk about three things in this speech firstly is money important for happiness second does the proposition decision make you lose your passion and thirdly i'm going to talk about propositions claim on morality firstly is money important for happiness under this theme i want to do three things one bring back our central frame about fleeting preferences and compare that fluctuation to the fluctuation of money second i'm going to explain why financial stability is only possible on our side and third i'm going to explain why even if those preferences aren't fleeting the financial stability we get on our side should be way heavier than the utility derived from those passions so firstly on the central frame of our preferences being fleeting here we told you two things one that you do not yet know what you like they say you have experience in your hobbies and your passion but you do not have experience in your hobbies and in your passion in the workplace there is a difference between cooking in your free time and cooking when you are beholden to a boss that bosses you around second the fact that passions shift with new life circumstances and experiences when a family comes around for example here's what's important to note people have limited passion capital we care about our passions because we think they are more important and desirable than other things on our list of priorities but that list changes over time and proposition has to lock in our preferences at one point assume they stay fixed and be before them for the rest of our lives no thank you they say money fluctuates yes money fluctuates but you have more of it on our side so you can weather against that fluctuation and prevent it from harming you i'm just not sure why that was a comparative claim so it is probably true that you might not have long term derivation of of utility from the passion that pop talks about obviously that frames the entirety of their case no thank you because that means all the meaning and fulfillment they derive is likely to disappear and fade away with time but second they compare this to money they say money doesn't make you happy because of the hedonistic treadmill i want to point out something very important here the reason that treadmill exists is that things become monotonous that is symmetric look at their language look at their language they say we get desensitized to the things that we keep pursuing over time that is their logic that is true of passions that you keep pursuing over time when that becomes the monotonous daily routine of your life the comparative then is this to some degree no thank you your life is going to be characterized by monotony on either side on our side with money you can buy different experiences with money you can buy travel you can care for your elderly parents you can retrain to transfer jobs because you have the money to take time off work so if their concern was monotony that is more happening on their side of the house that is why on balance the preferences that we get on our side of the house are probably more meaningful and more beneficial to the individual but now let's secondly talk about why financial stability is only possible on our side because they try to co-opt all our benefits by saying you can still live a comfortable way no thank you you are talented and a middle-class person three sets of responses number one in low-skilled jobs there are there's a high supply of workers there are tons of people who are willing to do it for their own enjoyment and because it's low skill there are tons of people who are qualified for those jobs given that the supply of workers in those fields is high the pay for those workers is likely to be quite low and that is a structural reason why they do not get to co-opt our benefits in terms of the money that you have second the fact that you are talented doesn't mean you are talented in that passion and given that these are low-skilled jobs because by influence from the fact that they are low paying it is difficult to stand out that is why there isn't massive variation in the amount that different teachers make in their salaries that's why oftentimes small businesses fail i guess at separate points small businesses often fail that's worth noting but also just the fact that it is difficult to stand out based on the talent and the skill that you have in these fields so they were disingenuous when conflating the degree of talent that you have with the degree of money you are going to make in these passionate fields thirdly though and this is crucial circumstances change you need more disposable income as a safety cushion even if you're comfortable now as a middle class person what happens when you get a family what happens when a recession hits relationships are going to be better on our side of the house when you have money for example to care for the elderly and here's what i'd point out you might have toxic competition in the workplace on either side of the house if you're trying to rise up the corporate ladder on both sides the thing about toxicity is probably symmetric the difference then becomes we get comfort and we can bring true joy to people we care about at the age of 20 or 30 you're probably not spending tons of time with your family anyway at the very least on our side you can financially support them with the money that you make so given that circumstances are going to change money is the greatest shield against those changing circumstances and that is why we're better for financial stability on our side the conclusion is that our preferences are more important a b we get more financial stability on our side the third thing i want to do in this theme is assume that their preferences and passions are more important and weigh that against financial stability the first thing to note is on stress and long hours we totally these were symmetric they need to work longer hours to get financial stability as a small business running a small business isn't like known for relaxed working hours by the way and then they say well look the info slide says our work is longer hours but if they want financial stability they're going to need to work long hours so they need to choose whether they want a relaxing schedule to avoid the stress or if they wanted more money they couldn't get both but realistically the hours are going to be roughly similar maybe they're longer on our side and i'm willing to concede the marginal increase there are three deadlock breakers then of why you should still vote opposition one because they might say at least you like your job so the stress hurts less but two things one we told you that eventually you're gonna stop liking these jobs because the monotony but two add the stress of financial stability instability which is all-consuming and more than the mitigation of liking the stressful job that you do the stress in the workplace is localized what about the fact that you can rent no thank you what about the fact that you can't pay for your insurance these things are all consuming and cause to us more distress than the stress of working long hours and that is why on balance even if they get more better care about our passions and you might like what you're doing the stress that they got on their side is all-consuming second on transferability the fact that you can change jobs through track three training because you have more money to do so on our side or the fact you can pursue your passions in your free time but thirdly that all other choices are freed up on our side if work hours are roughly symmetric at the very least on our side you have the money for example to decide where you live you have all kinds of other ways in which we derive utility opposition frees up those decisions for people to make on balance we are happier on our side that's the most important thing around second question does this make you lose your passion before that yeah given that the majority of your life spent in a job and the job that you do makes you miserable and most of your choice is going to be dictated by factors that you don't enjoy doing that is our argument like if you are arguing that on either side being unhappy in the workplace is a bad thing then that is a reason why you should prioritize money that frees up other choices you can make second thing then on whether this makes you lose your passion and this is charitable on the frame that even if these patches aren't pleading the process of being involved and making and monetizing them is going to decrease the amount of utility you drive from them our argument was things like pressure from bosses the long hours to remain financially stable are things that decrease the joy you get from your passion their response is you enjoy the process but here's the thing we like doing things when we are free to do them that is why i don't like school but i do like debating because it is a free choice that i make and i feel autonomous in making that choice even though the intellectual activities are roughly similar the point is this there are different ways in which everyone can derive happiness but what matters to me is that i feel that i have the choice and the freedom to choose what what it is that makes me happy and the comparison then is this the utility of the passions that proposition talks about is going to diminish over time but on our side into the long run we can have access to those passions anyway they say you don't have time to have access to those passions but if you have money you can retire far earlier and then have time to pursue them when it really matters to you crucially those passions matter more to you when you're elderly when you're in your when when you're retired because that is the moment at which you just want to relax and enjoy your and enjoy your life as opposed to the time where you're probably going to be stressed anyway in the workplace the passion is going to die on our side of the house we keep it alive on ours thirdly on morality they say you're going to do morally great things if you become an investment banker the first thing i point out is that most of these jobs do a net good for the world investment bankers perhaps with the recession with the exception of the financial crisis add money to the economy lawyers contribute to the aggregate function of justice even if there are some bad apples within it but second the likelihood that you do something bad is quite low someone else is probably going to commit the wrong but there is massive expected utility for all the reasons we gave you the first two themes that you can derive from it but thirdly we flip this claim by saying when you have money you are more capable to donate for altruistic reasons as somebody who rose from the middle class you knew what it was like probably at some point to work paycheck to paycheck and you're likely to be empathetic for those people so if the deadlock is morality you're more likely to fulfill it on our side propositions choice banks our future on fleeting passions and we could not accept that i'm very proud to oppose uh judges ready yep um okay i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and request the opposition reply speaker to conclude the opposition case here here can everyone hear me it is true that while right now you may have a passion for this specific activity we told you inside opposition that once you enter into a career and to the real world of adulthood and the modern economy a lot of that changes and you take on a lot of responsibilities outside of your workplace given that on opposition we've proven that in either world to some extent you will be able to pursue your passions probably more on our side too if you have more money to do so the question is whether money itself and that stability outweighs the marginal benefits of happiness that they get on the job from a job that they would like to talk about so then two main themes in this round then first is money a prerequisite for happiness second of all who better allows access to passions first is money a prerequisite for happiness now here proposition has two main central claims in the debate that the choice to do what you love gives you happiness and that this experience is what matters the most that this lasts and it cannot be taken away from you and that this process is something that is independently fulfilling we told you that all of those claims were non-exclusive to their side and actually could be better fulfilled on ours that money gives you the ability to invest in creating experiences that you can probably have a greater range of experiences like travel what you can afford to do with your family and for your family and also investing in passion projects that also may take money on the side that money gives you the greatest choice in where you can live and how you can live which is the most predominant facing thing that affects your life how do we outweigh their claims then about because we do concede to some degree they may get some happiness from this job we told you that it is not a guarantee forever that you're in your 20s and you're still figuring things out and that changes as well over time and that you shouldn't lock yourself in this one industry given no matter how talent you may be how talented you may be the skills that are not as transferable and you won't get as much money to be able to reinvest and change careers that even second of all if you get increased marginal happiness from the career itself that that is far outshadowed from all of the baggage and financial insecurity that comes with it that even if somehow you enjoy it slightly more in the process that you can't enjoy any of that if you're worrying about how you're going to send your children to the school that they want to go to that even if you're talented structurally all of these jobs are far more uncertain even if there's some risk in investment banking i would suggest that the risk of being a chef or owning a small business is probably far greater and far lower pay that is what keeps you at night that's what impacts your relationships more that's what is far more worrying because even if you may want to opt out of a consumerist society that is impossible we do live in a society and an unfortunate one where the economy actually sucks a lot so on net even if on the job itself there is a marginal increase in happiness we suggested to you that you're far more likely to be miserable overall because even if you have extra time take up from that job more of that time is stressing about how you're supposed to pay the bills and ensure that your family and your middle class family actually gets the life that you want to support them because even if you're passionate about it right now your passions change and your family might be mad what really matter to you later on but you can't support them at best what is important here is that the passion in your life is only one thing in a larger sphere of your life we suggest that your family present and future where you can live in that security blanket allows you that freedom and choice to guarantee you in the long run in whatever you may want to pursue better off so on the point about happiness we would suggest even if on the job they get the marginal increase that overall in your life you're probably going to be better and better off on our side when you don't have to stress as much and have all the mental burden and tolls that we talked about the second theme then on their very grounds who better allows us in access to passions we told you that the amount of time you spend on the job is probably relatively the same small businesses are all consuming teachers have work that follows them after work like marking and chefs have to work long and different shifts that on the job have physical labor that are also very exhausting that passion on their side is likely going to diminish given that you have to be beholden to clients and deadlines they told you that the process is what's valuable for you but that process was valuable because you could choose how you spent it those experiences that you want are going to be dictated by other people and on different terms in a structured workplace unlike if you're able to take it on our own terms so even if there's limited money we suggested having money a limited time having money allows you to maximize what you do with that time whether you can buy nice equipment to cook really well or to paint and that you can retire early and spend all your time doing that passion if you want but at the end of the day the marginal increase in happiness in the job was not worth it and we did not want to bank our entire future on a risky fleeting passion that in the end would not be able to suffice for your whole life for all those reasons very proud to oppose judges ready i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and request the proposition reply speaker to conclude the case for proposition here here hi can you hear me if i speak like this great panel the strategy of opposition in this debate is twofold firstly it is to try to narrow this debate as much as possible because they wanted to tell you that these two choices are more symmetrical than they are different i think this is a disservice to the spirit of the motion the info slide and the panel who has to judge this kind of debate but ultimately in their reply and third speech they do give us the ground that we need to make this debate realistic and to let us feel but secondly it is to make the entire case taught logical to say that the job market dictates the job that you should choose this in and of itself is a per version of the motion which constitutes or relies on the idea that you have this kind of choice in the first place i think the frame that you got in general speech that you will likely remain middle class that you will not live from hand to mouth or paycheck to paycheck remains strong three questions there firstly on bill secondly on fashion thirdly on relationships firstly on wealth and i think what is high here or what they need to prove is that no on ourselves in the house that people share a greater amount of financial stress firstly why do you think this is untrue by the end of the emotion first in a concession in poi in obsecon they prove that the value of your talent means that you are likely to succeed in whatever job you choose i think this is probability of success is far far higher to the point at which you are a person who could have been an investment banker but now chooses to be a teacher something that requires significantly less skill to do so you're likely to climb the corporate ladder in that respective field you're going to go from sushi to the main ship but second to make this comparative competition is more saturated from their second house so even if you're a reasonably talented individual the chances that you will be able to get as much money as they need in order to maximize their benefits is very very low you won't necessarily free your financial stress on the other side of the house and in fact the argumentation that we gave you was that when you have more money you have more financial stress because the idea that you have to invest this somewhere that you have to get as much return as possible from this was never dealt with the second idea on how you increase choice and reduce stress firstly you told you as to how on our side of the house comparatively people are able to opt out of consumerism more we can say that consumerism on both sides of the house still exists but on our side of the house when people make a calculated choice to not accrue as much wealth as possible like jeff bezos for example who keeps on making billions even though he's never going to be able to spend that when they choose to focus on more time for leisure and relationships they opt out of that but second i think you have less stress because you have more defined schedules you're not always on call as a doctor what little they respond to they didn't respond to the intrinsically competitive nature of these professions how they are raised to the top but second even if we concede that all of their benefits occur they only accrue by the point in time that you retire and you're 50 and 60 year old think about this panel your children have already grown up without a father you already have lost your relationship with the spouse the second question then on passion and this is how and the idea that passions are fleeting clear characterization here is that they are if you're 20 years old you probably know what you want to do this is about what you want to contribute to the world how you want to be remembered but secondly i would rather on our side of the house if in fact individuals hate jobs and hate deadlines and hate bosses they're going to hate them or whole over here a lot more on their side of the house when this boss is giving you work that you don't want to do at least if you're overworked on our side of the house that is doing work you actually enjoy so we're able to mitigate many of the harms of jobs that exist and the fact that most individuals spend most of their defining decade in a job means that this is important finally what didn't they respond to here first they never responded to how you have to do morally ambiguous things the point isn't that somebody else is going to do it the point is that you have to live with that on your consciousness secondly they never responded to as well the frequency of happiness is far far greater how when you genuinely are able to interact with children who are genuinely happier the fact that you are able to elevate them from a c to a b that is a more meaningful experience on our side of the house on both sides of the house the risk that you lose money exists exist exists small on the outside of the house because money fluctuates but on our side of the house lived experiences remain the third question then on relationships and i think the analysis here was never dead that on our side of the house people have more time to be able to invest in relationships with your family with children to be able to make a meaningful connection with these individuals when they are still children when that kind of thing is the most important my third argument on self-development and about for the contribution that you make as an investment backer to your hedge fund portfolio is instrumental at best was never dealt with the amount of uncomparative material we get from opposition is a reason in and of itself for us to win this debate side-by-side proposition i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and all the speakers for what was a wonderful debate if we can get a quick round of virtual applause um julio however however you're working this out so if the judges are staying in this room then please cut the feed and if you're moving us out that's okay as well year after year the world schools debating championship gathers the best debaters from around the globe this year's pandemic made that impossible so we took it online [Music] in this style of debate there are two teams the proposition team which is in favor of the motion and the opposition team which is against it each side features three speakers giving four speeches the first two speakers generally present constructive argumentation the third primarily focuses on refutation while the reply speaker summarizes the debate for the prepared rounds teams research the motions for weeks in advance for the impromptu rounds teams have only one hour to prepare after being told the motion youyear after year the world schools debating championship gathers

speakers from canada to put your names along with your speaking order onto the chat please and if both teams can let us know or you can do that before you start your speeches as well if you have a specific preference on how pois should be offered your two options being uh that the other team unmutes and asks a point of information or they hold up a card or visually indicates that okay okay so without further ado if i may please call upon the first speaker from team proposition to open the case for proposition here here can you hear me thank you channel the most heinous crime in human existence was never a single war or any single form of physical conflict it's not even a single act the worst crime happens every single day it's when the boy that dreamed of becoming a teacher grudgingly chooses to go to medical school it's when a lawyer sits back in her bench and wonders what would happen if she chose to cook it's when we look at who we are and what we became the people we left behind and reminisce the day that we chose to kill our own dreams because society told us to that is the world we oppose inside government three points of framing before i move into my arguments first in both worlds there's a guarantee of success to individuals that is to say given that we're talking about the average middle class individual who is talented enough to succeed at whatever field of their choosing whether to be a doctor a lawyer or a teacher for instance in both worlds you're probably still likely to be able to pay your bills send your kids to school and get food on the table so in this impact of passion we can see that in our you might not have all the comforts that they can claim on opposition you might not be incredibly wealthy but you still can probably maintain your middle class status you still have the fallback of the resources you have and you're likely to be stable second in this instance we're talking about when individuals are 20 to 30 there is often a defining decade in your life that is to say it is a period of life in your life that you can't go back so this debate is inherently a binary that is to say you cannot choose a single field and go back on it the majority burden is where you choose to continue in that field third what does this debate look like and what is the word we manifest in first and therefore the comparative they need to defend is where you get more pay and you work longer hours the characterization of this is often hectic and competitive feels like law where you need to put in a significant amount of effort but you might not necessarily be happy with the kind of work you do it might not give you a fulfillment we can see you might make a lot of money but that is different to getting the satisfaction from your work second our word looks like probably being paid less but you've still thought about it as something that you're willing to do the thing you dreamed about as a kid but you talked to your friends and said this was what i want my life to be or you envisioned it and you wanted to make it work a burden panel in this debate is simple it's to prove that our side provides a happier more fulfilled life in the now and the long term that is the burden that both sides have in this debate three arguments in my speech the first as to why passion makes people happy second as to how money is uniquely bad at creating happiness third why we get better relationships first argument then as to why passion makes people happy finally it's important to know that the value of our life is constructed from experience and everyone in this debate is probably going to conceive that life is valuable and you've only got a pretty limited amount of years on this word anyway and if the majority of them is spending a desk job that you dislike or doing something that does not give you the same amount of happiness and that is a subpar word in this debate so in that case everyone doing anything in this instance to get more money of finding friends is based on the idea that you make your life a better place first in our world you get more fulfillment from your job that is to say what you do is what you wanted to do as a child that means it's non-conditional on any hypothetical success or failure in your job so if i'm teaching a kid or if i'm acting in school for instance in all these instances irrespective of me getting higher pay respect to me landing goals the fact that i'm doing what i love gives you inherent happiness that they cannot claim in their way but second it materializes as memories that is to say there's an inherent amount of nostalgia associated with the work that you do because notice in doubt sure you're going to get money but money can fluctuate with through time like a bad investment can you mean you have less money the value of money for instance can deteriorate so in that world uniquely the amount of happiness you get or the amount of money you have in your bank can be stripped away from and the absolute worst instance say whether you're the victim of an accident or you're the victim of theft everything you built your life upon can be taken away compare that panel to memories that will never be stripped away from so in our the frequency of happiness increases that is to say when you're doing the job you love for instance when you teach in a preschool every day panel you get some amount of happiness where you see a struggling student trying from a b to c that is a unique amount of happiness that you get compare it to being an investment banker that wants a bonus that comes like once every two years that feels an incredible amount of anxiety and pressure while waiting for it i think that is a sub power for fourthly and finally you dip into morally gray areas that is to say in some portion of higher paying jobs the kind of actions you need to do often go against like individual moral comforts this isn't about corruption it's just things that sometimes distaste like an investment banker that needs to foreclose on the house of a purpose a lawyer that has to separate a dad from his two children in all these instances panel this detracts from the individual's life that is a harm to them before i want the second argument sure does probably believe that passions can change or fade away into the future i think by the time your 20 year passions are more or less fixed but even in that instance you can simply choose to undertake another passion but i think in your world you don't have the choice either second argument then why money cannot buy happiness and notice that the entire system of consumerism the idea that you need to take a high-paying job is manufactured by the ruling elite that is to say it's an inherently hierarchical structure that was made for by the ruling elite to maintain their power where he said some jobs are more valuable than others that someone flipping burgers for instance is necessary to the economy but still deserves to live in poverty we reject that consumerist premise at its root first consumerism is inherently short terms that is to say the dopamine rush by going on a fancy vacation or buying a large house is often a hedonic treadmill that is to say individuals never exactly a long term amount of happiness from money because you desensitize yourself to the exact same things that you're able to buy but second we live in a consumerist society so when you buy into the very premise of consumerism things like advertising that tell you that however rich you are you need to be richer and however much you have that is still not enough that is the kind of word you need to contend with when you buy into the lifestyle that says that money is the be-all and end-all of life but third there's an incredible amount of pressure to maintain yourself at that level the pressure of not performing as a high-stakes banker of not being a good enough lawyer inherently cuts into the value of the life you have and you become more insecure with larger amounts where you're worried about how you're going to invest worried about how that is going to pan out in your life all of these are unique harms that money brings that can never be fulfilling simply because it's a hedonic treadmill that never stops running third argument then as to how we get better relationships now notice that relationships are critical to the conception of ourselves very good life is dependent on the people we have around you and the family you have in their word how is family harm this is not to say that they don't get familiar relationships or they don't get friends that is not the argument it is that the relationships you have become subpar and tainted with the other conceptions that they talk about in that world you have less time to spend with your family that is you're worried about your position you have to spend more time at work because you're a constant raise to the top it's highly competitive so you need to be on call even when you're at home you cannot spend time with your children you have to hire nannies for instance because you cannot spend time with your wife in that comparative your relationship becomes subpar because for instance relationships have flaws you can argue with your spouse you can fight with your kids the comparative in our world is where you have more time to spend and work it out where you'd spend time with your kids and they have a deeper connection to you where you're more likely to be able to see their problems and they want to confide in you in that instance being their panel is half the struggle endeavor that is unaccessible in the most important years of the child's life because even if they can spend time with the child like when they're old that is incredibly different to being there in the short term finally then as to how they harm friends because your job inherently dictates your social circle because these are the people you hang out with the people you need to be with in their word it's often hyper competitive so your ability to make friends decreases because the immediate concern for most people in high stakes jobs is to make more money and get promotions but secondly and finance people with different values too people who chose to do high-stakes trouble because they wanted to succeed because they were inherently materials in that instance panel you lose out on relationships simply because these are people you cannot relate to because they don't have the same passions ultimately then panel you get subpar relationships you sell out on your life and you hurt yourself and you can never find happiness that is a word we oppose um are all the judges ready yep yep yep can everyone here like oh sorry yeah no that's absolutely fine uh thank that speaker for the speech and would like to request the first speaker from opposition to open the case for opposition here here it is very easy to find faults with a path of stable career to conjure up the image of an investment banker or the quote-unquote sell-outs that all debaters like to show disdain for but it is not a crime to want to have enough money to support your dream life to support your family and for the future family you hope to build on sign opposition we don't want to bank our future on fleeting and risky passions and for those reasons i'm incredibly proud to oppose there will be two constructive arguments coming out from the opposition bench first why money is the prerequisite for happiness and second of all why monetizing your passions is a horrible idea before that i'm going to get into some reputation of the proposition case the first problem we had with our case was this assertion that you would still be able to pay bills on either side of the house look at the fact that yes you may be middle class right now but the fact that the motion says that this is a low-paying job suggests to us that that is not a guarantee by any means especially in this job market and this and the status quo but let's take a look at their arguments more specifically in their first argument about why passions give you happiness they tell you that passions are not dependent on achieving some sort of objective metric of success that you derive inherent happiness from the memories you create on the job but we don't think this was true either no individual especially if they're passionate about it is going to be happy just being stuck as a bottom chef and an individual who wants to start a small business does not just want to function and run the business they want that business to succeed so it's very likely you're still going to be on some sort of metric for wanting to gain that next promotion or getting a high position even within your industry of success especially if you care about it presumably you want to be good at it and get recognition from that but the second part of this argument we just think that even if doing this activity gives you joy right now that that might not not last for very long that it is low paying means that you're going to have to work more hours and long hours at that in order to afford enough of the basic necessities that we think in a very expensive modern economy necessitate so you will be still working very long hours and stressful hours on both sides and the marginal benefit of perhaps being liking this job slightly are outweighed by the huge increase of financial stress that are all over-encompassing so even if you're slightly unhappier in the job of an investment banker day-to-day the financial stress follows you at every moment that's what keeps you up at night we don't think that is the image of true happiness that proposition wants to support finally their idea of morally gray areas we don't think is very true in this round like even though we'd like to say it in debate most investment bankers and corporate lawyers do not actively do malicious things in fact most of their jobs through their claims to be a boring job need to be relatively mundane things like mergers and acquisitions and if you are so moral and care about that we suggest that you being the person involved is probably better than someone else being involved finally their argument about why money does not give you real happiness is not really addressing who we're talking about in this debate that applies most to the top echelons of individuals who pass a certain threshold of wealth but for the average middle class individual that increase in money is extremely important and can make a big difference in changing your life and the life of those that you care about and we think the greatest detriment to breaking relations is actually financial stress the greatest harm on divorces and all those things happening is when you begin to feel like your means are not enough and you don't like the life that you are living even if on the job perhaps you have marginal more happiness so with that being said on to the first constructive argument for proposition then about why money no thank you is the pre-requisite for happiness i just want to at the top of this argument characterize what a dire state of the world we are in right now rent is exponentially rising the housing market is looking awful for millennials and people in their 20s the job market if you just take a look at it it's also not doing so hot right now either we think taking this job and the unique position you have to be able to have this job is an immense privilege and you should be able to take it for a couple of reasons first of all it gives you a basic level of security that we don't think passion jobs can give you you are a middle class individual and yes money after a certain point or threshold may not be has diminishing marginal returns but the median income for individuals needed to live a life in cities and in places where this individual maybe is growing higher and higher and higher at minimum you take away the huge burden that financial stress takes you when you're not anxious about the next paycheck coming in when you're not anxious about the ability to pay off your student debts and loans when you don't have to worry about the loss of your job what you can or can't afford which is a huge toll mentally on your happiness and mental health as well but second of all we think money is the greatest enabler of choice which all happiness comes from because all things and decisions you make in your life are guided in some way by financial constraints having financial constraints and barriers means that you have specific restraints on how you can construct your life and how you can provide for those that you love so look at how restricting not having money can really be where you live is determined by how much money you have how many kids you can even have even if you have them the burden that you feel whether to send them to university without worrying about the student debt that they might have to take on whether you have to worry about taking care of your own parents who by the way also come from the middle class family or even lower middle class that individuals helped you to attain an education where you're able to rise socio-economically we think money is the ultimate freedom and equalizer in enabling you to have choice in every other domain of your life to create happiness everywhere else outside of your career but finally we think it great gives you great flexibility for your human and cross-transfer ability because everyone at some point no thank you probably grows to regret or dislike their career in some capacity and know that passion careers are not immune to this either you are still very young you're in your 20s you don't have your passions necessarily fixed you don't know where you will be in a couple of decades from now but the problem is this is a long-term commitment and passions may be fleeting given that your exposure is due to isolated moments of hobbies and not a depending your whole career on it but the issue is that if you're a chef or a social worker you're limit limited to that industry now because you don't have any transferable skills to other areas compared to if you do not start on a corporate ladder you can never go back on it in the same way because this is the prime time now where you have this opportunity to develop those skills on our side when you have money when you have the skills and the backing and the resume and the experience in all these areas that means you have far more choice for what career industries you can enter into after so either way there's going to be some degree of unhappiness we think is uh very likely it is at least giving a lot more flexibility freedom and money is that safety cushion that allows you to experiment in far more ways that being worried about the next paycheck would ever give you before i move on to the second argument i'll take a py given that if the infostyle says that you are a young talented individual who is able to take a high-paying job isn't it reasonable to assume that you're probably going to be good at the low-paying job that you take yeah we never said you weren't going to be good at the low-paying job but no matter how good you are at that low-paying job that doesn't matter if you want to take a different career in a different industry in which none of your brilliant skills as a chef or social worker would ever be transferable we think being a corporate lawyer at least or an investment banker and a lot of areas have skills and values and money that helps you propel into other industries that you wouldn't otherwise be the claim was never about talent and ability but rather about cross-transferability of skills the second argument for us then is about why monetizing your passions is incredibly bad we think making your a career out of your passions is a very very bad idea because it sucks the joy out of it but i want to deconstruct a couple of reasons for why this is the case first of all the reason for why this was your passion is because you were able to do it on your own terms you have control over what you do and how you spend your time doing it but the problem is when you make a career out of it that is becoming what other people want you to do not what you want to do now you're beholden to clients and deadlines what they want you to cook cooking at home and cooking from your cookbooks is very different from being in a hot kitchen in the evening when you're beholden to your boss for example or when you're an artist or an individual contractor doing commissions and all those individual things which means the freedom and the control you have is significantly constrained but second of all we think it's a passion a lot of the times because it is an escape from the daily grind after the monotony of a job or the daily life but the passion now becomes the grind itself of the day that comes with a lot of baggage with it because the anxieties of not being able to make money the financial stresses are all wrapped up in this and the pressure from your boss for example from your workplace all of it becomes wrapped up in it and the ability to make means to an end but finally the long hours that come from this are also a reason for why your passions are likely going to sour you're likely going to have to work very long hours if opposite a proposition wants them to make enough money to afford rent in the status quo with the low paying job that you want now each hour pays way less and means it is very immensely stressful and it also becomes a lot more tiring and your relationship sours with it so the time that you spend on your job is likely going to be symmetric either way but at least on our side we have better access to passions when it is on your own terms and on your own time when you have the money to afford doing things like going on vacation and other passions that also apply on your life that even if it makes a difference you can retire early also and focus on your passions on your own time and your own terms instead of being dictated by a career that we think is more likely to make your passion sour on either side there's going to be stress we think on our world at least we have money which is the equalizer an enabler of a lot of different choices for all those reasons i'm very proud uh i want to check the judges are ready okay um i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and now request the second speaker from team proposition to continue the proposition case here hi can you hear me if i speak like this hello i want you to think very carefully about the last time that you saw a jubilant investment banker because both of my parents are doctors in reasonably high paying jobs and i haven't seen them smile in weeks they're too tired to come home and spend time with me and my sister they can't afford to spend time on the hobbies and luxuries of being able to live a reasonable middle class life because the demands of their job exist to the point where they need fulfilling those demands are incapable of fulfilling their passions they never dealt with this specific aspect of time and how that is taken away from you i'm going to have two areas of response in this piece firstly on passion secondly on money finally i'm going to give you our third argument about self-development and why we think we make it better firstly then on passion and the first contestant we get from side opposition is that passions are fleeting i have two responses to this firstly this debate is about a 20 year old who is making the decision as to what career to go into so it's reasonable to assume they've probably spent some time cooking or being a nurse for example and it's reasonable to assume their passions aren't surface level that they know enough about this job to know that this is what they want to do but secondly i would argue that argument cuts both ways i think the desire to accumulate more money is as pretty and in by nature itself is more fleeting than any passion because of the analysis that we gave you in first that money by nature is short-term that it is part of a greater consumerist structure but the short-term dopamine rush you get from buying another yacht can only be replaced by wanting to buy a second yacht panel but thirdly they never respond to the idea that this limits the time that you have and all they had to say to this was oh your skills aren't transferable the fact is banner they don't have to be transferable because you enjoy doing your job in the first place i've never heard of a stock broker for example who volunteers in a soup kitchen because he likes cooking that kind of thing doesn't happen secondly they argue that these professions aren't necessarily morally great i would argue that the 2009 financial crisis for example is a pretty morally great thing to do on part of investment bankers so i don't necessarily think that this album isn't correctly true but thirdly they say that you are beholden to your clients when you are passionate about your job and that sucks the passion out of it i want you to think about this argument very carefully because if people dislike being beholden to their clients that exists on both sides of the house and is not mutually exclusive what we do comparatively on our side of the house is that in the process of fulfilling your clients you gain a sense of enjoyment out of that process yourself so sure you as a sous chef for example ask your beholder to your main chef but the fact is if you like cooking then you're going to be happy in the process of making those individuals happier but finally this analysis on holidays and being able to retire notice the framing that we gave you knock second this is a defining decade your 20s your 30s and your 40s are a very important time in your life it's when you reflect back as a retired individual and decide whether they had i had a good life those kinds of things are determined by these kinds of decades if you spend the vast majority of your time when you are young working a job you do not like you will not be happy i don't think holidays are able to fulfill that gap secondly then on money and the first thing that they want to give here is a mechanistic quibble about how there's no guarantee of them one the infosight itself assumes that you are a talented middle class individual who probably lives in like a developed country or he's part of the middle class in the developing country i think it's reasonable to assume that you won't be leaving paycheck to paycheck but secondly i would argue that that argument cuts both ways because i think the guarantee of success in a high-paying job is far far lower because it is more saturated because it is the most talented individuals who want to become doctors and go through years and years of med school you now need to compete with those individuals comparatively on our side of the house if you're already a talented individual who could become a potential stock broker you're going to have a pretty easy time as a creature the likelihood that you will be able to climb the ranks in that job and eventually become a principal are far far greater secondly they talk to you about the precarious job market about how that's your reasoning of itself as to why you should opt into those kinds of jobs if anything i think that's an argument as to why you should only ever opt into becoming a high paying professional regardless of what your passion is on their side of the house they support all individuals going into the most high-paying job no because on their side the house they still recognize that passion is an important thing but third the fact of the matter is or thirdly what they say in response to our arguments is that everything is about money that where you live and what school you are able to send your children to are dictated by money first that cuts more their way because on their side of the house they increase the insecurity associated with having so much money that now to the point at which you have to manage the hedge fund of another individual or you have so much money that you need to be able to decide how am i going to keep this money safe from vultures how am i going to invest this money to best deal with on outside of the house we think by choosing a lower paying job that you are passionate about you opt out of the consumerist culture where you make an active recognition of the fact that i am giving up material comforts in the pursuit of passion so an answer to the house people don't care whether they will be able to live in the greatest and biggest mansions because they know that they are going to be fulfilled on their side of the house comparatively they buy into a consumerist culture where they know that the only way you are going to become happier is by working a higher payer but i want to very quickly highlight the analysis that they never responded to which is about the intrinsic value of gift experience and memories as opposed to mine first the fact that it cannot be taken away from you money fluctuates panel even among the most successful individuals and class mobility is extremely high you go up and down that ladder but your experience is uniquely accumulated because if you've been a teacher for 20 years you now have 20 years of positive league experiences interacting with students their value remains the same and increases over time but secondly the amount of anxiety associated regardless of how successful you are as an investment banker means that in the lead up to a make it or break it point in time in your career in the lead up to realizing whether or not you're going to get that promotion there's a massive amount of anxiety associated with all of those things they never responded to the intrinsic value of lived experiences in the context of having limited time before and one if you have it i'll take a point so if your argument is that money fluctuates comparatively more than passions that doesn't engage with our frame that passions can shift and at the very least when you have financial security you have the ability to choose different passions later on in life you have the ability to care for your family to travel if you might want to so if your concern is fluctuation isn't that fluctuation clearly greater on your side so two responses to that one once you've chosen one high paying job i don't think that there's a lot of mobility in terms of skills if you're a stock broker you can't afford to spend another 10 years in law school panel this argument is empirically untrue but secondly on our side of the house people have more time so even if you dislike at the very best even if you give full credit to the argument you dislike working in your own professional kitchen at least you can volunteer in a soup kitchen for example my argument then is going to be about how this leads to greater self-development thesis of this argument is that high-paying jobs by nature and because it's mentioned in the info slide take more time out of your life what does this mean for individuals three things first it means that they suffer from significant burden after you've come home from a stressful day at the stock market you cannot afford to do anything else you're so strung out from that experience that all you can do is sleep but secondly there's a huge cost on your physical and mental health overnights at the office are a regular thing in these professions that's not healthy but thirdly there is a sunk investment that you cannot make in things like a profession or some new things like your hobbies and your parental relationships this is individuals for example who cannot afford to spend time with their children and develop a meaningful relationship with them these are individuals who cannot take the time to learn an instrument what are the impacts first people lose out on the ability to gain utility out of minimum effort so minimum effort maximum utility things so things like the idle bliss of example for example playing a musical instrument or watching television are things that individuals cannot do because they do not have the time to do so but secondly i think there's more fulfillment to be gained from things like leisure activities because your contribution to the stock market as a stock broker is rather instrumental it does not matter in the grand scheme of things but you know what does matter it matters if you are able to do things that are genuinely fulfilling to you like be able to pay it matters if you have spent time with your family for example and have made a meaningful contribution to the lives of another individual you are only able to get those kinds of things on our side of the house on their side of the house they strip away the identities of individuals to be pointed with their instruments of a greater corporate structure side-by-side proposition are the judges ready i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and request the second speaker from opposition to continue the case for opposition here here can everyone hear me great the abstraction inside propositions language hides the assumptions at the core of their case that you can just opt out of consumerism and the vagueness they give about following your passions doesn't deal at all with what this really looks like being a small business owner is the most all-encompassing job we can imagine your entire life financial security family you live above your small business is banked on your career being a chef means working until 2 a.m in a line all of the realities of proposition are not the starving artist or the wealthy artists they wanted to conjure but things like being a social worker a teacher where your job follows you at home equally as much and they don't engage at all with the economic stresses of the modern economy you will be middle class but being middle class means living paycheck to paycheck it means staying up at night worrying about paying the bills and that is a kind of stress that is distinct from being stressed on the job it's not being told by your boss that you need to get the paperwork in by 2 p.m today it's not being able to fall asleep because you're worried that you have to go 100 000 into debt to pay for your child's education we couldn't deal with that kind of risk on side opposition because we are unwilling to bank our future on fleeting passions two questions i'll ask first on what does your career look like in either world second of all how can you access your passions and where is it symmetrical on either side the first quibble that we get from proposition is that you won't be poor we agree the point is that you will be middle class and being middle class is not great by any means in an increased in an economy of increased inequality their better claim is that you can escape the hedonistic treadmill of consumerism nowhere into this in this claim do they actually explain why you have particular intellectual access to all the great critical theory that will get you away from consumers and you will still be affected by consumerism you will still have jealousy over wealth and you will still be faced with all of the misleading and dangerous forces that companies use to make you want to buy things so they'll be all the problems of you buying into consumers and the difference is you won't have the money to be able to handle stuff like college health care etc they dismiss the seriousness of this claim no thank you but rates of heart disease mental illness and cancer are higher among the middle class than the wealthy the most basic functions of life like your health and mental illness are affected by your ability to pay for a therapist for instance for your child or your ability to get advanced health insurance to deal with preventative medical medical care those are the things we're talking about we're not talking about yachts in this debate neither side has enough money to buy a yacht we're talking about college healthcare extensive things that matter to individuals so don't let them strawman that claim their second area is that you get direct validation from experiences and experiences no thank you can never be taken from you two things i want to note about this first this does not engage with the frame from angela's speech the reason why we value passions are that passions allow us to feel like we are making a choice that we are escaping the hedonistic treadmill of consumerism and doing something different but the reason why money matters is that it frees up choice in every other aspect of your life what does that choice look like in their world you might be a teacher and you might get direct validation from the experiences of helping struggling students kind of people in either world it's not true that all investment bankers are heartless many of them went through the same choice that we're talking about now they chose whether to pursue an expensive career and as we note people still pursue passions on the side in fact most lawyers investment makers probably have to pursue passions on the side in order to make their lives non-miserable in nature we can see that but that's why it happens in this world the final thing to say is that they say that you that you're going to do morally gray things and that will make you unhappy note someone else will do those morally gray things if it's not you given their own framing about how hyper competitive these industries are so the real question is will doing morally gray things make you unhappy that's what they have to answer for this argument to hold any weight but it balances out if you're a corporate lawyer sure at one point you might work for a big bad pharmacy pharmaceutical company you might also lead the lead the tort suit against that big bad pharmaceutical pharmaceutical company these are generally morally neutral fields sure you might have to go through some suffering of foreclosing on a middle-class person but you also might be the investment banker that ensures that people have access to money because you increase the value of the stock market and people's investments by being a mutual fund manager this is technical but the point that we're trying to prove here is that you will do morally ambiguous or neutral things you might do good you might do bad but it's not going to be enough for a general trend to be drawn because you won't be doing bad things all day in your job that make you miserable at best it washes out onto the second question of what your passions will look like they don't really engage at all with this claim other than saying that you have limited time in order to pursue your passions so if i can prove that the amount of free time you have in either world is symmetric or more on our side in many cases then we're winning on this argument and the only point they have to respond to is in third so what do they say they say that lawyers sleep at the office in many cases the first thing to observe is that this is true of the defining decade under their own framing but the more senior you get in your career as an investment banker when you become a partner uh for instance the more free time you have by the time you're a partner at a firm you probably have a generally pretty decent 50 hour say work week but the second thing obviously is that what they have is a low paying job but at no point does low paying job means short hours the stress of being a teacher means staying up late to great assignments over your weekends you don't have weekends in many cases as a teacher and in fact being a chef for instance means that you work odd hours you might be a shift worker who has to work at night all of this is to say that your schedule will be very will be highly variable contract based and you will have no certainty at least when you're an investment banker or a lawyer sure the hours are long but you know what you know what you're doing you're not being called upon at any hour of the night to do work as a chef i'll take the point as a high stakes investment bank it is a fair possibility exist that you mess up an investment or get stolen from and lose the majority of money and you end up losing your job and being poorer sure that risk does exist but i think given props own framing about you being talented you're probably less likely to mess things up that just cut both ways into their arguments we assume a reasonable degree of average success the normal life in a career we're not sure where they're going like that what is our argument on passions this wins us the round we explain that if you do have a passion first of all it is highly likely to be fleeting your exposure to deciding that you want to be a teacher or social worker probably comes from some kind of defining experience you had a teacher or a psychologist or a therapist who helped you at some point in your life you don't really know what the career is going to look like on either side you are 20 year old who has very little idea what your career path will look like at the end the difference is you have no certainty about how happy it'll make you in this world but you do have certainty over money in our world that is the one constant that you'll have the extent of their analysis is that money makes you unhappy because it's stressful to invest it really just hire someone to do your investing for you and let them take a 2.5 percent cut that's a very unsubstantial reason to say that money makes you unhappy and no one's buying a yacht in this world so clearly you're not on the hedonistic treadmill for the same degree you cannot escape consumerism on either side but you can get basics for your family and your life in ours importantly though your passion is ruined if you like cooking you are not going to like working at 2am in a hot kitchen or taking orders from a head chef or getting years and fun years of apprentice training you will like the ability to cook for yourself at home all of this is to indicate that a your passions change all the time because your passions are generally ways to deal with the stress of your everyday life as a university student at a university in this world making your choices your passions are disproportionately important to you because they are a way to escape from your academics so for instance if you're into playing music that is likely to be disproportionately important to you in your 20s than it is later in your life all of this is to say that your passions will shift there's no guarantee that you'll always enjoy cooking you'll find a new passion at some point in your life in our world you can retire at 60 travel with your family gain basic security and pursue those passions in a way where you're not distracted by being on call as a nurse for the next patient ultimately happiness was higher in our world certainty was higher in our world and we knew that the basic level of prerequisite for success and happiness in life is money in the economy that we live in for that reason we are proud to oppose um are the judges ready okay i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and would like to request the third speaker from team proposition to conclude the constructive case for proposition here can you hear me if i speak like this thank you ever since i had an excellent school teacher in grade seven i have wanted to be a teacher but that does not mean that my passion is fleeting that means that i've researched into the kinds of things that teachers have to do in their day-to-day life that means that i have to research the subjects that i think i want to teach that means that the degree i'm going to choose after this debate is over and i have to pull and do my university applications is that of education in some other university somewhere around the world passions aren't necessarily fleeting because it is about what you want to contribute to society this is about how you want your legacy to be remembered is how you want to be think of yourself as an individual i'm going to answer two questions in this speech first are you happy inside your job second are you happy outside of your job i think the metric by which you need to judge this debate is that of choice especially given the opposition frame that choice is one of the most important things that an individual should do but i quickly want to characterize what these two jobs look like one in the info slide it says that you work long hours in the job that is higher paying i think canada just i don't know just didn't read this or something but the fact is that we can i think we can take it for granted that you do work longer hours on the outside the house and impact this later but secondly in the higher paying job that is necessarily something which is very high paying that is something which are going to get lots of money so sure you're not necessarily open you might be upper middle class on their side but necessarily be able to afford a lot of things that the person outside cannot do on our side so you will be buying yachts you will be doing a lot of consumerist things on their side of the house again i'll impact this later first question on are you happy inside your job and the first thing that we get from opposition is that you're not guaranteed success especially given the current job market and we live in a messed up world so on and so forth but the answer to that to the poi and the concession they make in their second stage is fundamentally contradictory to this claim that is to say that you're good at your job that you probably have a lot of transferable skills given that you have the choice between several types of jobs or a high pain or a low pain one the fact is that you're probably going to be able to climb the ladder even within the lower pair job so you might be a teacher but they're more likely to be a principal given that you're a person who's able to become a stock broker if you want to but you choose to become a teacher in the first place so the guaranteed success on either side does exist is a frame we don't think they can they contested successfully on their side house the second thing that they say is that money gives you the most amount of choice that you don't have financial stress and things like that i'm first going to show you that there's it exists an incredible amount of stress on deaths of the house as the extension of the amount of money that you have rather than the lack of it one that the job that you're working is extremely competitive know that they did not respond to this down the bench they can't do that in op3 and reply panel the fact is that you often have to like compete with the others be raised to the top the fact is that other people are probably out to get your job the fact that is that you probably like to be anxious about the promotion that you think you need or you deserve but you're unlikely to get because of the fact that you're not like as good as a job as the other individuals in your job it's extremely saturated it's extremely competitive on their side we think that that that contributes to a huge amount of stress but secondly i just want to point out that the majority of choices that you make in your life are that of which you do in your job that is to say if 50 of my entire life is spent in my job panel that means the majority of choices that i make are in my job the fact that opto concedes that is probably a miserable life that you have as an investment backer means that the majority of the choice that you make inside a job are a choice that are probably not going to make you happy that you cannot derive fulfillment the only thing that you do derive fulfillment from no thank you is the amount of money that you get so the fact is that you but that whether it is inconsequential at the point at which you're not getting money at that exact moment and therefore unlikely to feel satisfied in that exact moment but thirdly recognize that we give an argument but insecurity the fact that you are you're always afraid as to how you're going to spend the money whether you're making the best investments because money is your driving motivation they did not respond to this again a bit late in opt-in reply the impact of this in this debate is that it doesn't matter how much money you accumulate and does not matter how much choices you have because the overwhelming amount of choice that you have on their side contributes that insecurity and therefore that stress but finally the argument of consumers right now thank you where they say that consumers and exists on both sides of their house and they try to wash this out but the fact is that the more money you have the more likely you are to buy into this consumer's culture the more likely you are to previously spend your money so sure you're going to spend on your kids education we don't deny that but you're also going to spend on lots of other things and these other things are going to feed in that consumer's culture on our side of the house at the point which you have less resources comparatively you don't buy into the culture as much because even though the social influences exist the fact that you cannot impact it out in your own life means that they're more likely to opt out of it in the majority of cases no thank you the second thing i'm going to deal with is the idea of passion right where they say that you can you shouldn't monetize your fashion within your own job but i would argue that you follow your passion for the sole purpose of being able to do as much as you can in that fashion so sure i can cook at home but i don't get the kind of ingredients i don't get the kind of expertise i would if i was a sous chef under extremely round chef i cannot make clients happy from only cooking for my family so the more choices that you make in your job at outside the house greatly contributes to your happiness as an individual given that you can are now able to make choices that you otherwise wouldn't have been able to do but finally when they get with it we gave you an argument about when you lose everything right no thank you and they can see this you know up to pui that you're likely to be able to lose everything on either side of the house sure either side of the house you lose things on our side we gave you an argument as to why the memories and the nostalgia associated with the choices that you make are more likely to stick with you are more likely to make you feel happy and fulfilled as opposed to their side when you lose money you lose absolutely everything so at every level you're more happy with the choice that you make short term and in the long term so in this and therefore we think you're more likely to be happier on outside the house so even if you buy the argument that you have more choices outside of your job everywhere else the fact that you have more choices within your job which are actually more likely to make you happy in the vast majority of instances means that you should wear this argument in our favor before my second clash i'll take your point if the extent of the prop refutation to our argument on financial insecurity is that you can become a principal or a celebrity chef do all the harms about being miserable from having money and having responsibility not equally apply improv if you're super talented and that's the rest sure but you're more likely to feel stressful at the point at which you have a job that you don't enjoy and you want the money off on our side you have a lot of money as a principal but you're actually happy because you are principal in the first place that's more likely to balance out that stress and actually get take away that stress on outside the house than your side second clash then on who's happier outside of their job the first thing i want to talk about is that of long hours where they say that you're going to be able to apparently have like be able to pay someone to else to do your job and just chill at home and do whatever you want i don't think that's within the scope of this debate this debate is in an instance or a context by which you have to work long hours in order to get the money that you deserve but secondly when they argue that there's no certainty in the schedule of the individual has to work as a teacher and it's stressful on outside the house as well one we would argue that that is true to a certain extent but it is not true for the vast majority of jobs where you are able as a social worker to dictate the amount of time that you should that you can spend where you are as a teacher be able to identify with how much time you need to spend on correcting papers and in the classroom the point here is that in the vast majority this can change on like on job to job but the point is that when you have a higher paying job you have more things to worry about you have more resources that you need to handle you're more humans that need to contact you you have more things that you need to do to get more money on there somehow so it's reasonable to assume you have to work longer hours in terms of the logic of this argument the impact of this then as correctly identified by opto so you have less time on their side of the house one this means you spend less time with your family two it means that you have less time to do things like self-development like play an instrument or watch the kind of tv shows that you want and entire third argument which they haven't responded to the impact of that argument that even if you're symmetrically happy because of your job on either side of the house on our side you're more likely to feel fulfilled at the end of the day come to terms with yourself and who you are but secondly we told you that friends are more competitive and here they say not all investment backers are bad but think about the comparative in this argument that is that if you're a teacher all other teachers are also like you have similar passions you can identify and relate with them on the comparative on their side people want your job people want your money that is the reason why they took their job that means it's more likely to be competitive and less likely to be your friends right at the very least they'll only be surface little friends and service level validation even as an extension that so outside your job you're less likely to do things that make you happy you're less likely to have people that make you happy so on their side even if you can spend more money on your family it is not as impactful at the point at which you don't know your family as well you are unable to actually actualize that happiness on on outside the house panel you have more happiness within your job you have more happiness outside the job side with the proposition um are the judges ready i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and request the third from opposition to conclude the opposition substantive case here here can everyone hear me right yeah um if my wi-fi breaks out max or angela just shoot me a text okay i'm going to talk about three things in this speech firstly is money important for happiness second does the proposition decision make you lose your passion and thirdly i'm going to talk about propositions claim on morality firstly is money important for happiness under this theme i want to do three things one bring back our central frame about fleeting preferences and compare that fluctuation to the fluctuation of money second i'm going to explain why financial stability is only possible on our side and third i'm going to explain why even if those preferences aren't fleeting the financial stability we get on our side should be way heavier than the utility derived from those passions so firstly on the central frame of our preferences being fleeting here we told you two things one that you do not yet know what you like they say you have experience in your hobbies and your passion but you do not have experience in your hobbies and in your passion in the workplace there is a difference between cooking in your free time and cooking when you are beholden to a boss that bosses you around second the fact that passions shift with new life circumstances and experiences when a family comes around for example here's what's important to note people have limited passion capital we care about our passions because we think they are more important and desirable than other things on our list of priorities but that list changes over time and proposition has to lock in our preferences at one point assume they stay fixed and be before them for the rest of our lives no thank you they say money fluctuates yes money fluctuates but you have more of it on our side so you can weather against that fluctuation and prevent it from harming you i'm just not sure why that was a comparative claim so it is probably true that you might not have long term derivation of of utility from the passion that pop talks about obviously that frames the entirety of their case no thank you because that means all the meaning and fulfillment they derive is likely to disappear and fade away with time but second they compare this to money they say money doesn't make you happy because of the hedonistic treadmill i want to point out something very important here the reason that treadmill exists is that things become monotonous that is symmetric look at their language look at their language they say we get desensitized to the things that we keep pursuing over time that is their logic that is true of passions that you keep pursuing over time when that becomes the monotonous daily routine of your life the comparative then is this to some degree no thank you your life is going to be characterized by monotony on either side on our side with money you can buy different experiences with money you can buy travel you can care for your elderly parents you can retrain to transfer jobs because you have the money to take time off work so if their concern was monotony that is more happening on their side of the house that is why on balance the preferences that we get on our side of the house are probably more meaningful and more beneficial to the individual but now let's secondly talk about why financial stability is only possible on our side because they try to co-opt all our benefits by saying you can still live a comfortable way no thank you you are talented and a middle-class person three sets of responses number one in low-skilled jobs there are there's a high supply of workers there are tons of people who are willing to do it for their own enjoyment and because it's low skill there are tons of people who are qualified for those jobs given that the supply of workers in those fields is high the pay for those workers is likely to be quite low and that is a structural reason why they do not get to co-opt our benefits in terms of the money that you have second the fact that you are talented doesn't mean you are talented in that passion and given that these are low-skilled jobs because by influence from the fact that they are low paying it is difficult to stand out that is why there isn't massive variation in the amount that different teachers make in their salaries that's why oftentimes small businesses fail i guess at separate points small businesses often fail that's worth noting but also just the fact that it is difficult to stand out based on the talent and the skill that you have in these fields so they were disingenuous when conflating the degree of talent that you have with the degree of money you are going to make in these passionate fields thirdly though and this is crucial circumstances change you need more disposable income as a safety cushion even if you're comfortable now as a middle class person what happens when you get a family what happens when a recession hits relationships are going to be better on our side of the house when you have money for example to care for the elderly and here's what i'd point out you might have toxic competition in the workplace on either side of the house if you're trying to rise up the corporate ladder on both sides the thing about toxicity is probably symmetric the difference then becomes we get comfort and we can bring true joy to people we care about at the age of 20 or 30 you're probably not spending tons of time with your family anyway at the very least on our side you can financially support them with the money that you make so given that circumstances are going to change money is the greatest shield against those changing circumstances and that is why we're better for financial stability on our side the conclusion is that our preferences are more important a b we get more financial stability on our side the third thing i want to do in this theme is assume that their preferences and passions are more important and weigh that against financial stability the first thing to note is on stress and long hours we totally these were symmetric they need to work longer hours to get financial stability as a small business running a small business isn't like known for relaxed working hours by the way and then they say well look the info slide says our work is longer hours but if they want financial stability they're going to need to work long hours so they need to choose whether they want a relaxing schedule to avoid the stress or if they wanted more money they couldn't get both but realistically the hours are going to be roughly similar maybe they're longer on our side and i'm willing to concede the marginal increase there are three deadlock breakers then of why you should still vote opposition one because they might say at least you like your job so the stress hurts less but two things one we told you that eventually you're gonna stop liking these jobs because the monotony but two add the stress of financial stability instability which is all-consuming and more than the mitigation of liking the stressful job that you do the stress in the workplace is localized what about the fact that you can rent no thank you what about the fact that you can't pay for your insurance these things are all consuming and cause to us more distress than the stress of working long hours and that is why on balance even if they get more better care about our passions and you might like what you're doing the stress that they got on their side is all-consuming second on transferability the fact that you can change jobs through track three training because you have more money to do so on our side or the fact you can pursue your passions in your free time but thirdly that all other choices are freed up on our side if work hours are roughly symmetric at the very least on our side you have the money for example to decide where you live you have all kinds of other ways in which we derive utility opposition frees up those decisions for people to make on balance we are happier on our side that's the most important thing around second question does this make you lose your passion before that yeah given that the majority of your life spent in a job and the job that you do makes you miserable and most of your choice is going to be dictated by factors that you don't enjoy doing that is our argument like if you are arguing that on either side being unhappy in the workplace is a bad thing then that is a reason why you should prioritize money that frees up other choices you can make second thing then on whether this makes you lose your passion and this is charitable on the frame that even if these patches aren't pleading the process of being involved and making and monetizing them is going to decrease the amount of utility you drive from them our argument was things like pressure from bosses the long hours to remain financially stable are things that decrease the joy you get from your passion their response is you enjoy the process but here's the thing we like doing things when we are free to do them that is why i don't like school but i do like debating because it is a free choice that i make and i feel autonomous in making that choice even though the intellectual activities are roughly similar the point is this there are different ways in which everyone can derive happiness but what matters to me is that i feel that i have the choice and the freedom to choose what what it is that makes me happy and the comparison then is this the utility of the passions that proposition talks about is going to diminish over time but on our side into the long run we can have access to those passions anyway they say you don't have time to have access to those passions but if you have money you can retire far earlier and then have time to pursue them when it really matters to you crucially those passions matter more to you when you're elderly when you're in your when when you're retired because that is the moment at which you just want to relax and enjoy your and enjoy your life as opposed to the time where you're probably going to be stressed anyway in the workplace the passion is going to die on our side of the house we keep it alive on ours thirdly on morality they say you're going to do morally great things if you become an investment banker the first thing i point out is that most of these jobs do a net good for the world investment bankers perhaps with the recession with the exception of the financial crisis add money to the economy lawyers contribute to the aggregate function of justice even if there are some bad apples within it but second the likelihood that you do something bad is quite low someone else is probably going to commit the wrong but there is massive expected utility for all the reasons we gave you the first two themes that you can derive from it but thirdly we flip this claim by saying when you have money you are more capable to donate for altruistic reasons as somebody who rose from the middle class you knew what it was like probably at some point to work paycheck to paycheck and you're likely to be empathetic for those people so if the deadlock is morality you're more likely to fulfill it on our side propositions choice banks our future on fleeting passions and we could not accept that i'm very proud to oppose uh judges ready yep um okay i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and request the opposition reply speaker to conclude the opposition case here here can everyone hear me it is true that while right now you may have a passion for this specific activity we told you inside opposition that once you enter into a career and to the real world of adulthood and the modern economy a lot of that changes and you take on a lot of responsibilities outside of your workplace given that on opposition we've proven that in either world to some extent you will be able to pursue your passions probably more on our side too if you have more money to do so the question is whether money itself and that stability outweighs the marginal benefits of happiness that they get on the job from a job that they would like to talk about so then two main themes in this round then first is money a prerequisite for happiness second of all who better allows access to passions first is money a prerequisite for happiness now here proposition has two main central claims in the debate that the choice to do what you love gives you happiness and that this experience is what matters the most that this lasts and it cannot be taken away from you and that this process is something that is independently fulfilling we told you that all of those claims were non-exclusive to their side and actually could be better fulfilled on ours that money gives you the ability to invest in creating experiences that you can probably have a greater range of experiences like travel what you can afford to do with your family and for your family and also investing in passion projects that also may take money on the side that money gives you the greatest choice in where you can live and how you can live which is the most predominant facing thing that affects your life how do we outweigh their claims then about because we do concede to some degree they may get some happiness from this job we told you that it is not a guarantee forever that you're in your 20s and you're still figuring things out and that changes as well over time and that you shouldn't lock yourself in this one industry given no matter how talent you may be how talented you may be the skills that are not as transferable and you won't get as much money to be able to reinvest and change careers that even second of all if you get increased marginal happiness from the career itself that that is far outshadowed from all of the baggage and financial insecurity that comes with it that even if somehow you enjoy it slightly more in the process that you can't enjoy any of that if you're worrying about how you're going to send your children to the school that they want to go to that even if you're talented structurally all of these jobs are far more uncertain even if there's some risk in investment banking i would suggest that the risk of being a chef or owning a small business is probably far greater and far lower pay that is what keeps you at night that's what impacts your relationships more that's what is far more worrying because even if you may want to opt out of a consumerist society that is impossible we do live in a society and an unfortunate one where the economy actually sucks a lot so on net even if on the job itself there is a marginal increase in happiness we suggested to you that you're far more likely to be miserable overall because even if you have extra time take up from that job more of that time is stressing about how you're supposed to pay the bills and ensure that your family and your middle class family actually gets the life that you want to support them because even if you're passionate about it right now your passions change and your family might be mad what really matter to you later on but you can't support them at best what is important here is that the passion in your life is only one thing in a larger sphere of your life we suggest that your family present and future where you can live in that security blanket allows you that freedom and choice to guarantee you in the long run in whatever you may want to pursue better off so on the point about happiness we would suggest even if on the job they get the marginal increase that overall in your life you're probably going to be better and better off on our side when you don't have to stress as much and have all the mental burden and tolls that we talked about the second theme then on their very grounds who better allows us in access to passions we told you that the amount of time you spend on the job is probably relatively the same small businesses are all consuming teachers have work that follows them after work like marking and chefs have to work long and different shifts that on the job have physical labor that are also very exhausting that passion on their side is likely going to diminish given that you have to be beholden to clients and deadlines they told you that the process is what's valuable for you but that process was valuable because you could choose how you spent it those experiences that you want are going to be dictated by other people and on different terms in a structured workplace unlike if you're able to take it on our own terms so even if there's limited money we suggested having money a limited time having money allows you to maximize what you do with that time whether you can buy nice equipment to cook really well or to paint and that you can retire early and spend all your time doing that passion if you want but at the end of the day the marginal increase in happiness in the job was not worth it and we did not want to bank our entire future on a risky fleeting passion that in the end would not be able to suffice for your whole life for all those reasons very proud to oppose judges ready i'd like to thank that speaker for their speech and request the proposition reply speaker to conclude the case for proposition here here hi can you hear me if i speak like this great panel the strategy of opposition in this debate is twofold firstly it is to try to narrow this debate as much as possible because they wanted to tell you that these two choices are more symmetrical than they are different i think this is a disservice to the spirit of the motion the info slide and the panel who has to judge this kind of debate but ultimately in their reply and third speech they do give us the ground that we need to make this debate realistic and to let us feel but secondly it is to make the entire case taught logical to say that the job market dictates the job that you should choose this in and of itself is a per version of the motion which constitutes or relies on the idea that you have this kind of choice in the first place i think the frame that you got in general speech that you will likely remain middle class that you will not live from hand to mouth or paycheck to paycheck remains strong three questions there firstly on bill secondly on fashion thirdly on relationships firstly on wealth and i think what is high here or what they need to prove is that no on ourselves in the house that people share a greater amount of financial stress firstly why do you think this is untrue by the end of the emotion first in a concession in poi in obsecon they prove that the value of your talent means that you are likely to succeed in whatever job you choose i think this is probability of success is far far higher to the point at which you are a person who could have been an investment banker but now chooses to be a teacher something that requires significantly less skill to do so you're likely to climb the corporate ladder in that respective field you're going to go from sushi to the main ship but second to make this comparative competition is more saturated from their second house so even if you're a reasonably talented individual the chances that you will be able to get as much money as they need in order to maximize their benefits is very very low you won't necessarily free your financial stress on the other side of the house and in fact the argumentation that we gave you was that when you have more money you have more financial stress because the idea that you have to invest this somewhere that you have to get as much return as possible from this was never dealt with the second idea on how you increase choice and reduce stress firstly you told you as to how on our side of the house comparatively people are able to opt out of consumerism more we can say that consumerism on both sides of the house still exists but on our side of the house when people make a calculated choice to not accrue as much wealth as possible like jeff bezos for example who keeps on making billions even though he's never going to be able to spend that when they choose to focus on more time for leisure and relationships they opt out of that but second i think you have less stress because you have more defined schedules you're not always on call as a doctor what little they respond to they didn't respond to the intrinsically competitive nature of these professions how they are raised to the top but second even if we concede that all of their benefits occur they only accrue by the point in time that you retire and you're 50 and 60 year old think about this panel your children have already grown up without a father you already have lost your relationship with the spouse the second question then on passion and this is how and the idea that passions are fleeting clear characterization here is that they are if you're 20 years old you probably know what you want to do this is about what you want to contribute to the world how you want to be remembered but secondly i would rather on our side of the house if in fact individuals hate jobs and hate deadlines and hate bosses they're going to hate them or whole over here a lot more on their side of the house when this boss is giving you work that you don't want to do at least if you're overworked on our side of the house that is doing work you actually enjoy so we're able to mitigate many of the harms of jobs that exist and the fact that most individuals spend most of their defining decade in a job means that this is important finally what didn't they respond to here first they never responded to how you have to do morally ambiguous things the point isn't that somebody else is going to do it the point is that you have to live with that on your consciousness secondly they never responded to as well the frequency of happiness is far far greater how when you genuinely are able to interact with children who are genuinely happier the fact that you are able to elevate them from a c to a b that is a more meaningful experience on our side of the house on both sides of the house the risk that you lose money exists exist exists small on the outside of the house because money fluctuates but on our side of the house lived experiences remain the third question then on relationships and i think the analysis here was never dead that on our side of the house people have more time to be able to invest in relationships with your family with children to be able to make a meaningful connection with these individuals when they are still children when that kind of thing is the most important my third argument on self-development and about for the contribution that you make as an investment backer to your hedge fund portfolio is instrumental at best was never dealt with the amount of uncomparative material we get from opposition is a reason in and of itself for us to win this debate
